# Bootcamp Challenge 01: HTML CSS and Git - Code Refactor

## Description

This project was done to update an example marketing webpage to be more in line with modern accessability standards to be optimized for search engines. Non-semantic elements (e.g. <div>) were replaced with modern HTML5 semantic elements (such as <section> and <header>). The CSS stylesheet was also consolidated and formatted to be much more readable. This website can now be easily modified going into the future. I learned a lot about refactoring HTML code and organizing CSS stylesheets.
